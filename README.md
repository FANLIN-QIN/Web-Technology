##2. Server-side Scripting with Flask,JSON
       In this project, I create a web page that allows users to search for information regarding movies and TV shows using the TMDB API. 
       And the results will be displayed on cards below the search query. Upon clicking a button in the card, a modal will pop up and display more information about that selected movie/TV show.

    ● Developed a responsive web page for searching TVs and movies and display results on detailed pages for specific move or TV show 
       using Angular 10 and Bootstrap 4.
    ● Designed a backend service using TMDB API in Node.js to retrieve and populate the information of top-
      rated and trending TVs and movies
    ● Deployed the whole program in Google App Engine and managed project version controls using Git
