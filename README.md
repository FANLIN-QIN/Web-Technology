2. Server-side Scripting with Flask,JSON and TMDB API
       In this project, I create a web page that allows users to search for information regarding movies and TV shows using the TMDB API. And the results will be displayed on cards below the search query. Upon clicking a button in the card, a modal will pop up and display more information about that selected movie/TV show.
